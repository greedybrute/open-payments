## Prerequisites

<Disclosure toggleText='Install the Open Payments package' client:load>

This package provides the following TypeScript and Node.js tools for using Open Payments.

- Exported TypeScript types generated directly from the Open Payments OpenAPI specifications
- A Node.js client that exposes Open Payment APIs and:
  - Signs requests with provided key
  - Validates responses against OpenAPI specs

```
npm install @interledger/open-payments
```

<Disclosure toggleText='Create an unauthenticated client' client:load>
:::caution
This is included as an example for the template. Only the authenticated client is applicable when making an OTP.
:::

An unauthenticated client can make requests to access publicly available resources without needing to authenticate. The two available methods are (get) a wallet address and (get) keys bound to a wallet address.

```js
import { createUnauthenticatedClient } from '@interledger/open-payments'

const client = await createUnauthenticatedClient({
  requestTimeoutMs: 1000, // optional, defaults to 5000
  logger: customLoggerInstance // optional, defaults to pino logger
})

const walletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
  url: '<enter wallet address URL>'
})
```

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure toggleText='Create an authenticated client' client:load>
An authenticated client provides the same methods as the unauthenticated client, as well as the remaining Open Payment API methods for both the authorization and resource specs. Each request requiring authentication will be signed using [HTTP Message Signatures](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/tree/main/packages/http-signature-utils) with the given private key. Installing the Open Payments page also installs the Open Payments HTTP Signature Utils Library.

```
import { createAuthenticatedClient } from '@interledger/open-payments'

const client = await createAuthenticatedClient({
  keyId: KEY_ID,
  privateKey: PRIVATE_KEY,
  walletAddressUrl: WALLET_ADDRESS_URL
})
```

Provide the following properties to create the client.

| Property         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| keyId            | The key identifier of the given private key and the corresponding public JWK document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| privateKey       | The private EdDSA-Ed25519 key that’s bound to the wallet address and used by the client to sign authenticated requests A public JWK document created from and signed with the privateKey must be available at the `{walletAddressUrl}/jwks.json` URL. You can use methods from the  [@interledger/http-signature-utils](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/tree/main/packages/http-signature-utils) package to simplify EdDSA-Ed25519 key provisioning and JWK generation. |
| walletAddressUrl | The valid wallet address with which the client making requests will identify itself. The wallet address will be used as the value of the `client` parameter when [making a new grant request](https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/post-request). A JWKS document that includes the public key that the client instance will use to protect requests must be available at the `{walletAddressUrl}/jwks.json` URL.                                                               |
