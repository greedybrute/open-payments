## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An installed package manager, such as npm, pnpm, or yarn.
- An Interledger testnet account. Sign up for an account at [Rafiki.money](https://rafiki.money).
- A USD payment account on testnet funded with at least $11.
- A payment pointer for the USD payment account.
- The [Open Payments code snippet package](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets).

## Set up

<Disclosure toggleText='Get a public and private key' client:load>
  1. Access testnet. 2. Go to Settings > Developer Keys. 3. Expand the drop-down
  menu for your account. 4. Click *Generate public & private key*. The private
  key will automatically download to your machine as a `.key` file. The private
  key will also appear in a dialogue within Testnet. Close the dialogue. 5. Move
  the downloaded `private.key` file into the root directory of your snippets
  repository.

<Disclosure toggleText='Set up your .env file' client:load>
Set up your `.env` file to  initialize an authenticated Open Payments client.

1. Ensure you are at the root of the code snippet repository, then run:
   ```shellscript
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open the newly created `.env` file.
3. Fill in the following variables in the `# Client` section, then save the file.

- KEY_ID - Copy this value from testnet
- PAYMENT_POINTER - Copy this value from testnet, replacing the `$` with `https://` (e.g., `$ilp.rafiki.money/alice` will be `https://ilp.rafiki.money/alice`).

You are now ready to start working with the Open Payments snippets.

## Request a grant for an incoming payment

Ensure you are still at the repository root.

In your terminal window, run:

```shellscript
pnpm grant:ip
```

where `pnpm` is your preferred package manager.

Copy the resulting `INCOMING_PAYMENT_ACCESS_TOKEN` value and fill in the corresponding variable in your `.env` file.

Save the file.
