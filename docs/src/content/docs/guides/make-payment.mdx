import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { Disclosure } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

<mark>
  We'll only have TypeScript at first, so there's no reason to have tabs, but
  when we have more languages, we'll use tabs. Example below.

## One-time payment

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label='TypeScript'>
    lorem `ipsum`
    <Disclosure toggleText='Install the Open Payments package' client:load>
      Stuff
    </Disclosure>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='Other Lang'>lorem ipsum</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Recurring payment
